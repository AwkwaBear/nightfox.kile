Nightfox-based themes for the Kile LaTeX editor

***The original NVIM themes are developed by EdenEast and available [here](https://github.com/EdenEast/nightfox.nvim) I have only adapted them to Kile with the assistance of ChatGPT, I assume no credit for the creation of these themes but would like to make them publicly available for anyone else looking to use them with kile.***

The following Kile themes are available in this repo:
- Nightfox
- Dayfox
- Dawnfox
- Duskfox
- Nordfox
- Terafox
- Carbonfox

## Installation:
- Clone the repo somewhere you can find
- Open Kile
  - Navigate to Settings > Configure Kile > Color Themes > Theme Editor > Import
  - Select theme to import
  - Click the Default Theme tab in the Theme Editor
  - Select your theme from the dropdown
  - Press Ok
  - If your theme is not showing up correctly close and reopen Kile and it should be applied
    - **Note: There is another way to change themes via the navbar at the top with Settings > Editor Color Theme but AFAIK it only applies the theme immediately but will reset to the Default Theme set above when Kile is closed and reopened, be sure to use the Default Theme setting instead**

These themes have been recreated using chatGPT following the JSON template of an existing theme (Tokyo Night Storm), there are definitely improvements that can be made and I welcome any pull requests to improve the use of these palette colors. The one that fits most properly is Nightfox because it is the one I was most interested in.
